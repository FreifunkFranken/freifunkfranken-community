Purpose of these files
======================
They describe all Freifunk Franken communities (http://franken.freifunk.net/) in a standardised way, the so called Freifunk-API.

Freifunk-API
============
For more information about the Freifunk-API see https://github.com/freifunk/api.freifunk.net

Our Freifunk Franken community files have been added to the global Freifunk-API directory (https://github.com/freifunk/directory.api.freifunk.net).

All the community files listed in the global Freifunk-API directory are used by different applications, like:
